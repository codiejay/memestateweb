        placements increases, since advertisers target a more engaged and active
        audience. Additionally, free players who earn rewards are incentivized
        to use their winnings to participate in the prize table, which drives up
        prize table volume and generates even more revenue. This dynamic creates
        a cycle where player engagement fuels both ad demand and prize table

        the game itself generates revenue through play-to-earn mechanics,
        in-game purchases, and participation fees for the prize table. This
        dual-revenue system ensures that both the game and the ecosystem remain

        The reward system is designed to be self-reinforcing. Increased rewards
