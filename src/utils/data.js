    title: "increased advertisement demand and prize table volume",
    description:
      "The reward pool is directly funded by 100% of advertising revenue and 50% of prize table revenue. As the user base grows, demand for ad placements increases, since advertisers target a more engaged and active audience. Additionally, free players who earn rewards are incentivized to use their winnings to participate in the prize table, which drives up prize table volume and generates even more revenue. This dynamic creates a cycle where player engagement fuels both ad demand and prize table growth.",

    title: "increased advertisement AND GAME REVENUE",
    description:
      "The integration of strategic ad placements ensures higher ad revenue as the user base grows. These ads are seamlessly tied to gameplay and community activity, making them relevant and engaging. At the same time, the game itself generates revenue through play-to-earn mechanics, in-game purchases, and participation fees for the prize table. This dual-revenue system ensures that both the game and the ecosystem remain profitable and sustainable while continuing to grow.",

    title: "Bigger Rewards Pool for Free Player",
    description:
      "With 100% of advertising revenue and 50% of prize table revenue feeding the reward pool, free players benefit from progressively larger rewards as the system grows. These increased rewards encourage participation, as free players are drawn to the opportunity to earn and reinvest their winnings. By using their rewards to compete on the prize table, they further boost prize table volume, which in turn increases overall revenue and feeds back into the reward system.",

    title: "A Continuous Upward Spiral",
    description:
      "The reward system is designed to be self-reinforcing. Increased rewards attract more players, who boost engagement and revenue through ad views, prize table participation, and in-game purchases. This additional revenue feeds back into the reward pool, creating bigger prizes and greater incentives for new and existing players. This cycle of growth and reinvestment leads to a continuous upward spiral, driving the Memestate ecosystem to new heights.",
